In Java, **functional interfaces** are interfaces with a single abstract method (SAM). While you cannot directly overload methods in a functional interface (since it would no longer be a SAM), you can achieve similar behavior by using **default methods** or **static methods** in the functional interface. These methods do not count as abstract methods and can provide additional functionality.

Hereâ€™s a **thorough practical example** in the fintech domain:

### Example: Overloading-like Behavior in Functional Interfaces for Financial Calculations

#### 1. **Define a Functional Interface with Default and Static Methods**
You can add `default` and `static` methods to a functional interface to simulate overloading.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface FinancialCalculator {
    double calculate(double principal, double rate); // Abstract method (SAM)

    // Default method (acts like an overloaded method)
    default double calculate(double principal, double rate, int years) {
        return calculate(principal, rate) * years;
    }

    // Static method (acts like another overloaded method)
    static double calculate(double principal, double rate, int years, double additionalAmount) {
        return (principal * rate * years) + additionalAmount;
    }
}
```

---

#### 2. **Implement the Functional Interface**
You can implement the functional interface using a lambda expression or a method reference.

```java
public class FinancialInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda implementation for the abstract method
        FinancialCalculator interestCalculator = (principal, rate) -> principal * rate;

        // Using the abstract method
        System.out.println("Interest (2 args): " + interestCalculator.calculate(1000, 0.05)); // Output: 50.0

        // Using the default method
        System.out.println("Interest (3 args): " + interestCalculator.calculate(1000, 0.05, 5)); // Output: 250.0

        // Using the static method
        System.out.println("Interest with additional amount: " + FinancialCalculator.calculate(1000, 0.05, 5, 100)); // Output: 350.0
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Abstract Method**: The `calculate(double principal, double rate)` method is the single abstract method (SAM) required for the functional interface.
2. **Default Method**: The `calculate(double principal, double rate, int years)` method provides additional functionality and can be called on an instance of the functional interface.
3. **Static Method**: The `calculate(double principal, double rate, int years, double additionalAmount)` method is a utility method that can be called directly on the interface without requiring an instance.

### 3. **Practical Use Case: Overloading-like Behavior in Financial Streams**
You can use this approach in streams to handle different types of financial calculations.

```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class FinancialStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinancialCalculator interestCalculator = (principal, rate) -> principal * rate;

        // Stream of principal and rate pairs
        Stream<double[]> financialData = Stream.of(new double[]{1000, 0.05}, new double[]{2000, 0.04}, new double[]{1500, 0.03});

        // Using the abstract method
        financialData.forEach(data -> System.out.println("Interest: " + interestCalculator.calculate(data[0], data[1])));

        // Using the default method
        System.out.println("Interest for 5 years: " + interestCalculator.calculate(1000, 0.05, 5));

        // Using the static method
        System.out.println("Interest with additional amount: " + FinancialCalculator.calculate(1000, 0.05, 5, 100));
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Functional Interface**: Must have only one abstract method.
- **Default Methods**: Provide additional functionality and can act like overloaded methods.
- **Static Methods**: Provide utility methods that can also simulate overloading.
- **Streams**: You can use these methods in stream operations for flexible financial calculations.

This approach allows you to simulate method overloading in functional interfaces while adhering to the single abstract method rule, making it highly useful for financial computations.
